# dial9 Trace Analysis Skill

dial9 traces capture the internal behavior of a Tokio async runtime: task polling, worker thread activity, queue depths, CPU profiling samples, scheduling delays, and task lifecycle events. You can analyze them programmatically using Node.js.

## What traces capture

- **Poll events**: Every time a worker thread polls a task future (start/end timestamps, task ID, spawn location)
- **Worker lifecycle**: Park/unpark events with CPU time and kernel scheduling wait
- **Queue depth**: Periodic samples of the global injection queue
- **Task lifecycle**: Spawn and terminate events with spawn location
- **Wake events**: Which task woke which other task, and on which worker
- **CPU samples**: Periodic stack traces from perf/eBPF, attached to the poll they occurred in
- **Scheduling samples**: Stack traces captured when the kernel deschedules a worker thread (shows blocking calls)
- **Clock sync**: Monotonic-to-wall-clock anchors for correlating with external logs
- **Span events**: Enter/exit events from `tracing` spans (`#[instrument]`), showing what happened inside each poll with field values and nesting

## Instrumenting your app

Run `dial9-viewer agents skill setup` for full setup instructions (prerequisites, macro and manual setup, tracing layer, wake tracking).

## Quick start (analysis)

Get the analysis toolkit:

```bash
dial9-viewer agents toolkit /tmp/d9-toolkit
node /tmp/d9-toolkit/analyze.js <trace.bin>
node /tmp/d9-toolkit/analyze.js <directory-of-traces/>
```

This copies `decode.js`, `trace_parser.js`, `trace_analysis.js`, `analyze.js`, and `analyze_worker.js` into the target directory. Run `analyze.js` for a full diagnostic report, then edit any of the files to drill deeper.

For directories, `analyze.js` automatically parallelizes across CPU cores and caches parsed results to disk (`.d9-cache/` inside the trace directory). Re-running skips already-cached files. Use `--force` to re-parse, or `--sample N` to analyze only N evenly-spaced files from large runs.

### Parsing traces manually

```javascript
const { parseTrace, EVENT_TYPES } = require('./trace_parser.js');
const { buildWorkerSpans, attachCpuSamples, buildActiveTaskTimeline,
        computeSchedulingDelays, buildSpanData } = require('./trace_analysis.js');

// Single file (pass a path or a buffer)
const trace = await parseTrace('trace.bin');

// Directory of traces: returns an async iterable of {file, trace}
// Automatically parallelizes and caches to .d9-cache/
for await (const { file, trace } of await parseTrace('/path/to/traces/')) {
  // trace has the same shape as single-file parseTrace output
  const workerIds = [...new Set(
    trace.events.filter(e => e.eventType !== EVENT_TYPES.QueueSample && e.eventType !== EVENT_TYPES.WakeEvent)
      .map(e => e.workerId)
  )].sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const maxTs = trace.events.reduce((m, e) => Math.max(m, e.timestamp), -Infinity);
  const spans = buildWorkerSpans(trace.events, workerIds, maxTs);
  // ... same analysis API as single-file
}
```

Directory options: `{ force: true }` to ignore cache, `{ sample: 50 }` to parse only 50 evenly-spaced files, `{ parallel: false }` to force sequential processing.

## Fetching traces from S3

If `dial9-viewer` is running (e.g. on port 3000), fetch traces via its API:

```javascript
// Search for traces
const resp = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/search?bucket=BUCKET&q=2026-04-09/19');
const objects = await resp.json(); // [{key, size, last_modified}, ...]

// Fetch and parse a trace (server gunzips and concatenates segments)
const keys = objects.map(o => `keys=${encodeURIComponent(o.key)}`).join('&');
const traceResp = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/trace?bucket=BUCKET&${keys}`);
const buf = Buffer.from(await traceResp.arrayBuffer());
const trace = await parseTrace(buf);
```
