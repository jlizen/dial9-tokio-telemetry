# dial9-viewer design

## Overview

`dial9-viewer` is a trace viewer and analysis toolkit for dial9 runtime traces. It has two modes:

- **Web UI**: Rust HTTP server that fetches traces from S3, serves the viewer HTML/JS, and provides a REST API (`/api/`) for listing, searching, and fetching traces. The API can also be used directly via `curl` or scripts without the browser UI.
- **Agent toolkit**: JS scripts (`analyze.js`, `trace_parser.js`, `trace_analysis.js`) that parse and analyze traces programmatically. Distributed via `dial9-viewer agents toolkit <dir>`.

## Agent skills (steering)

The viewer bundles markdown "skills" that teach AI agents how to use the toolkit. These are compiled into the binary at build time by `build.rs`:

- `skills/header.md` → `HEADER` constant (printed by `dial9-viewer agents`)
- `skills/*.md` (except header) → `SKILL_FILES` array (printed by `dial9-viewer agents skill <name>`)
- `toolkit/*` (symlinks to `skills/` and `ui/`) → `TOOLKIT_FILES` array (written by `dial9-viewer agents toolkit <dir>`)

The header is the entry point. An agent runs `dial9-viewer agents`, reads the header, discovers available skill segments and the toolkit command, then copies the toolkit and starts analyzing.

## Agent toolkit architecture

### Single file

`parseTrace(buffer)` decodes the binary trace format (via `decode.js`, a WASM-based decoder) and returns a `ParsedTrace` with events, CPU samples, symbol tables, and task lifecycle data. Analysis functions in `trace_analysis.js` derive higher-level structures (worker spans, scheduling delays, task timelines) from the parsed trace.

Browser mode is single-file only; directory parsing, caching, and subprocess parallelism are Node.js-only.

### Directory (multi-file)

`parseTrace(directoryPath)` returns an async iterable of `ParsedTrace`, one per file:

1. Spawns one subprocess per file (concurrency capped at CPU count)
2. Each subprocess parses the trace and writes the full `ParsedTrace` as NDJSON to `.d9-cache/`
3. The iterator yields one `ParsedTrace` at a time, keeping memory bounded

`for await (const trace of parseTrace(input))` works for both single files and directories. Warm runs read cached NDJSON directly (no subprocesses needed for cached files).

### analyzeTraces (aggregated analysis)

`analyzeTraces(path)` returns aggregated results across all files. Use it for summary statistics; use `parseTrace` when you need per-trace raw data (flamegraphs, field filtering, wake chains). Two parallel phases:

1. **Parse phase**: subprocesses populate the NDJSON cache
2. **Analysis phase**: subprocesses each read one cached file, run the full analysis pipeline, and output a partial accumulator as JSON to stdout

The main process merges partial accumulators via constant-memory streaming merge: summing counts, keeping top-N findings, and feeding values into native histograms for exact percentiles.

See `agents skill analysis` for the full return schema.

If any file fails to parse or analyze, the entire operation fails immediately rather than skipping the file. This is a known limitation; partial failure tolerance may be added in the future.

### Cache format

`.d9-cache/<filename>.json` contains NDJSON (one JSON record per line, tagged by type) to avoid V8's string size limit. The reader splits a Buffer on newlines and parses each line independently.

Cache invalidation is mtime-based. `--force` bypasses the cache.
